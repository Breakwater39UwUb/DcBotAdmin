## System requirements analysis

The music bot should be able to find songs easily by
given conditions, such like song type, cord, language, lyrics,
instruments for song attributes and artist, composer, singer for creators.

User could share songs in the channels, once a song is shared,
the system check if this song has already been shared and remind the
duplicate sharing.
